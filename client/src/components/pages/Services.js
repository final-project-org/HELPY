                    You might think that going to do your groceries or shopping
                    is <br />
                    easy and fun, but this task is a wish for many people.

                    <br />
                    people such as old people, people with limited movement,
                    sick
                    <br />
                    people... are struggling every time to find someone to help
                    them <br /> with this task. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic
                    deepens this
                    <br /> issue because of the many restrictions that are
                    imposed on us.
                    <br />
                    There is a crucial need to develop an app to help these
                    people to <br />
                    find volunteers easier to help do their groceries and
                    deliver them to
                    <br />
                    their addresses. At the same time motivate volunteers to
                    connect <br />
                    and provide this service for free. The App will be an
                    intermediate
                    <br /> or a link to connect vulnerable people who need to do
                    their
                    <br />
                    groceries with volunteers who are willing to help. You might
                    be a
                    <br />
                    volunteer today, but someone who needs volunteers tomorrow!
